			<I>Google Must Honor Requests to Delete Links, European Court Rules</I>
		</h1>
		<h5>
			By DAVID STREITFELD, JAMES KANTER and MARK SCOTTMAY 13, 2014

			The highest European court on Tuesday gave individuals the right to influence what can be learned about them through <B> Web searches </B>, rejecting long-established practices about the free flow of information on the Internet. Before, people who did not like what was being said about them online needed to go the original source of the information and persuade the website to delete it. That was arduous and often impossible. But the European court said the middleman -- the search engine -- could be asked to simply delete the links.

			In some ways, the court is trying to erase the last 25 years, when people learned to routinely Google every potential suitor, partner or friend. In 1990, finding out the true history of a blind date or business collaborator was practically impossible. "This is a good opinion for free expression," said William Echikson, who oversees free speech for Google in Europe.
